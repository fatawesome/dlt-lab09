## JavaScript VM vs. Injected Web3
JavaScript VM runs a virtual machine inside a browser and starts new blockchain each time the page is reloaded.
Injected Web3 Provider connects to some provider (e.g. Metamask) that communicates with some real blockchain 
and, hence, all information persists in the blockchain.
